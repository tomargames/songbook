	Things to work on:
		Metronome:
			accent string 
			make metrnomome info part of set info
			think about counting measures in a set, and adding it to set data 
		Reports:
		Music:
		--> test case bluesette, trying to get meter in3
		--> run conversion, spin off BPM tag to new metronome field {bpm: 090, meter: ABABABABB, res: 2(// 0 == 16th, 1 == 8th, 2 == quarter note)}
		--> tom cat goodbye, ? chord and need to finish chart
		--> razor boy -- could be in Gb rather than F# so it can be in Ebm
		--> change the display that you get when it substitutes an accidental to a property on the songcode record in the usage file, when you redo a chart, you first remove each reference to that song in the usage file, then redo the chart with references to the new chords
		--> triple-stack notes, you've got a friend, somewhere test cases
		--> double=stack notes, hymn of axcion outro
		--> unevenness of lines in columns, it's too late test case at the piano
		--> redo key signatures on haven't we met test case, why Bm7 and Cbm7 both
		--> every little thing she does chords
		views: LIST for role U: TT, DK, TG(summary), TM, SB, LL -- TG will display detail on hover, TT will link to chart is CS == 0 or 1 
			   LIST for role O: TT, DK, TG(summary), TM, SB, LL -- TG will display detail on hover, TT add hover to include RN, RL, RA, RT, CD, and CS	
			   DETAIL will keep Save, Chart, History, Copy, Import, Display all review notes, and review options
		throw it away, need to do minor keys so it's C#m instead of Dbm
		add a keyword for modulation, figure that stuff out, downtown is testcase, i'd rather be blue, my cherie amour
		things not working: double music line, N in pattern for single notes
		do thumbnail during updateReview process, or maybe live during getNote?
		chords and help screens in modal or better, make a page for it that you bring up in a new tab
		highlight title in displaySong even in owner role if there's a chart, revamp what displays on hover
		* add setting for sort of due cards to config.json
		* redo panel where decks are displayed -- make them listed on the left with other things in there too
		back-end music process in updateReviewFile -- tokenize lyric words and chord bits to make stats on similarity among sets in a song, send back analytics
		setting button open a tab in online json editor
		add accidentals (#, aug, etc) to settings file?
		put chart status on review panel
		HISTORY BUG if you change same tag on same day
		keyword for vocalizing 
		keyword for second music line
		tailor max columns to screen size
		history report, add days scheduled to the display
		and that will have a top line for first and second endings and shit
		put special character glossary in settings file
		include all the terms, description, in and out, and then use it to feed a js display
		addTag move, just make one for each that appears when you +
		dictionary/glossary of expressions created, like diminished, augmented, major seventh, inversions, etc
		*** put history stuff in dropdowns, no selection, just use it to browse
		*** do it for tag browsing, too, and include how many cards have that tag, sort by it
		*** move people column to the left
		History:
			add/edit history notes, spawn a new tab to do it
			add note to history, will bring up history with notes field
			add option to suspend card to inactive
		Display:
			bug: colors don't match between tag header and tag -- detail line is correct color, headers are off on Owner role only
			make 'due' for each deck a link with appropriate query
			pre-fill the tag ctg code in the input, make it separate from rest of tag, display then add
		Other decks:
			copy from one repository to another if you're owner on both
		Settings:
			add deck color to settings
			make a template config.json file for new owners
			edit configuration file and user list
		Timer:
			timer button to populate the field after timing
			make time field next to timer clock which can update it
			and have a separate clock running during review
		Metronome:
			spin BPM tag into its own field, ultimately tied to metronome
